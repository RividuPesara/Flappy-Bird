# Flappy Bat

A Flappy Bird-style game built using HTML5 Canvas and JavaScript. To practice animations, I used a **bat sprite**. Players control a bat that must navigate through moving obstacles while avoiding collisions, aiming for the highest score possible. This project was created as a **small personal project to practice JavaScript** and understand concepts like animations, physics, and event handling.

## How to Play

- Press **Space** or **Arrow Up** to make the bat jump.
- Avoid colliding with pipes or obstacles.
- Each obstacle passed adds **1 point** to your score.
- If the bat hits an obstacle or falls off-screen, the game ends.
- Press **Space** or **Arrow Up** after a game over to restart.
